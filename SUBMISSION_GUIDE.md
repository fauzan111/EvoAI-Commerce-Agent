## ðŸ“¸ Graph Screenshot

Run this command to get the ASCII graph for your screenshot:
```bash
python visualize_graph.py
```

## ðŸš€ Final Steps

1. **Zip/Upload your project** - All files are ready
2. **Copy the test outputs above** into your Notion template
3. **Take a screenshot** of the graph visualization
4. **Fill in your assumptions/trade-offs** (see suggestions below)

## ðŸ’­ Suggested Assumptions/Trade-offs/Next Steps

**Assumptions:**
- Mock LLM responses for testing without API costs
- Simple heuristic-based size recommendations
- Rule-based ETA calculations by zip code prefix
- 60-minute policy uses strict timestamp comparison

**Trade-offs:**
- Chose deterministic tools over LLM-powered recommendations for reliability
- Used mock agent for testing to avoid API key requirements
- Simplified size logic vs. complex ML-based recommendations
- Local JSON storage vs. real database integration

**Next Steps:**
- Integrate with real Shopify APIs
- Add ML-based size recommendations using customer data
- Implement real-time inventory checking
- Add support for multiple product categories
- Enhanced error handling and retry logic
- Performance optimization for large product catalogs

## âœ… Verification

Run this final check:
```bash
python run_all_tests.py
```

You should see: "ðŸŽ‰ ALL TESTS PASSED! Your EvoAI Commerce Agent is ready for submission."

**You're all set! ðŸŽ¯**
